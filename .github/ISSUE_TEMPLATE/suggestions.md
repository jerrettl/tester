**What topic is your feature request on? Is it already in the table of contents?**
The name of the topic in question, and a description if it is not already in the materials. Ex. Goto is not in the table of contents.

**Describe the solution you'd like. Is it new content, further description, more elaborate practice problems?**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Describe the origin of this idea. Did it come from an online resource, from a lecture, or some other reachable source?**
The name of the source material, if there is any. We all have good ideas or need a better explanation sometimes. Ex. Dr. Whowuzit showed us this very nice example problem that would be great for the problem set.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. Some professors may not want you sharing their examples online, and we want to respect that. Links to webpages that had content you want added can be put here, though.
